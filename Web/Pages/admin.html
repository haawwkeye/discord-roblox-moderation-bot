            This is the current online admin users list
            This will list all the current admins online and there rank
            Rank will be based on the permission level so example:

            -1 is None
            0 is VIP (This is just how I give VIP server owners access to kick and other stuff)
            1 is Trial Mod
            2 is Mod
            3 is Admin
            4 is Super Admin
            5 is Developer(s)
            6 or above is Owner(s)

            Now this is only an example of what I did so the ranks MIGHT not be correct in your case

            This is for alerts but mainly for command responses
            When we send a command we wait for a response if it times out we send an "error"
            Something like: "Error: CommandName Timed out"
            This will also allow for more then one response since we can append it
            and we can just have a script handle the backend of things like how long it's there etc
            Should be easy to do Plus I can always add an api to auto generate the html
            then it will insert that ofc I will escape the html I'm not that dumb

        <!--
            Simple command list this also has the permission level required for the commands
            So I might automate this via scripts since we can just make it so the command list
            only shows what you at you're current level can handle
            I could also make command auto generate via changing some code in the commands
            But this is just a simple list for now

                        Anything after this will most likely be auto generated
                        can't really do much the most I can do is add the bot and auto gen after
                        Since the bot has an id of 0 (1 is the lowest userid or should be)
                        so the bot will never change besides maybe the username/perms /shrug
